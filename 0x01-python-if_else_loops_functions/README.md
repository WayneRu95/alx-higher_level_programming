# 0x01 Python - if/else, loops, functions

This repository contains exercises and projects related to Python programming focusing on if/else statements, loops, and functions. It is part of the ALX software engineering curriculum.

## Description

This project encompasses a series of Python scripts and exercises aimed at understanding and implementing if/else statements, loops, and functions in Python. Each script addresses specific concepts within these topics, providing examples and practice problems.

## Content

The repository is organized into different directories, each representing a specific concept or exercise. Here's an overview of the main directories and their contents:

- **0-positive_or_negative.py**: Contains a Python script that generates a random number and prints whether it is positive, negative, or zero.
- **1-last_digit.py**: Includes a Python script that generates a random number, determines its last digit, and prints messages based on specific conditions.
- **2-print_alphabet.py**: Contains a Python script that prints the alphabet in lowercase using a loop.
- **3-print_alphabt.py**: Includes a Python script that prints the alphabet in lowercase except for specific letters using loops and conditional statements.
- **4-print_hexa.py**: Contains a Python script that prints numbers from 0 to 98 in decimal and hexadecimal format.
- **5-print_comb2.py**: Includes a Python script that prints all possible combinations of two digits using loops and formatting.
- **6-print_comb3.py**: Contains a Python script that prints all possible combinations of two different digits using loops and formatting.
- **7-islower.py**: Includes a Python function that checks for lowercase characters.
- **8-uppercase.py**: Contains a Python function that converts lowercase letters to uppercase.
- **9-print_last_digit.py**: Includes a Python function that prints the last digit of a number.
- **10-add.py**: Contains a Python function that adds two integers.
- **11-pow.py**: Includes a Python function that computes the power of a number.
- **12-fizzbuzz.py**: Contains a Python function that prints the numbers from 1 to 100 following specific conditions (FizzBuzz).

## Usage

To run any of the scripts or functions within this repository, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine using `git clone`.
2. Navigate to the specific directory containing the script or function you want to execute.
3. Run the script using the command `python <script_name.py>` or import the function into your Python environment.

For example:
```bash
$ python 0-positive_or_negative.py
