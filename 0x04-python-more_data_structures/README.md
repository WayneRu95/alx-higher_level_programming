# 0x04. Python - More Data Structures: Set, Dictionary

This repository contains exercises and examples related to Python's more advanced data structures - sets and dictionaries.

## Overview

In this project, we delve deeper into the concepts of sets and dictionaries in Python. These data structures offer powerful ways to organize, manipulate, and store data efficiently.

### Topics Covered

- **Sets**: Understanding the concept of sets, their properties, and how to work with them in Python.
- **Dictionaries**: Exploring dictionaries, key-value pairs, various operations, and practical applications.
- **Common Operations**: Demonstrations of common operations and methods associated with sets and dictionaries.
- **Use Cases**: Examples illustrating the practical usage of sets and dictionaries in solving problems.

## Files

- `0-square_matrix_simple.py`: Python script to compute the square value of all integers in a matrix.
- `1-search_replace.py`: Python function that replaces all occurrences of an element by another in a new list.
- `2-uniq_add.py`: Python function to add all unique integers in a list.
- ...
