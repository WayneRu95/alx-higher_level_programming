## Description

This repository hosts solutions for various networking tasks implemented in Python. These tasks cover fundamental concepts such as making HTTP requests, handling responses, working with URL parameters, and more.

## Tasks

The tasks completed in this repository include:
1. **0. What's my status? #0**: A Python script that fetches an URL using `urllib`.
2. **1. Response header value #0**: A Python script that takes in a URL, sends a request to the URL, and displays the value of the `X-Request-Id` header variable.
3. **2. POST an email #0**: A Python script that sends a `POST` request to a passed URL with a parameter `email` and displays the body of the response.
4. **3. Error code #0**: A Python script that sends a request to a URL and displays the body of the response (decoded in UTF-8) and manages HTTP errors.
5. **4. What's my status? #1**: A Python script that fetches an URL using `requests` package.
6. **5. Response header value #1**: A Python script that takes in a URL, sends a request to the URL, and displays the value of the variable `X-Request-Id` in the response header.
7. **6. POST an email #1**: A Python script that sends a `POST` request to a passed URL with a parameter `email` and displays the body of the response.
8. **7. Error code #1**: A Python script that sends a request to a URL and displays the body of the response and manages HTTP errors.
9. **8. Search API**: A Python script that takes in a letter and sends a `POST` request to `http://0.0.0.0:5000/search_user` with the letter as a parameter.
10. **9. My GitHub!**: A Python script that uses the `GitHub API` to display a GitHub user's id.
11. **10. Time for an interview!**: A Python script that uses the `GitHub API` to display a GitHub user's id and the number of public repositories they have.
12. **11. Twitter Auth**: A Python script that reads your Twitter credentials from environment variables and uses them to authenticate against the Twitter API to display your id.
