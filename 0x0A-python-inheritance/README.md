## Description

Inheritance is a fundamental feature in object-oriented programming where a new class inherits properties and behaviors from another class. This project explores the concept of inheritance in Python, demonstrating its usage, advantages, and how it helps in code reusability.

## Files

- `0-rectangle.py`: A Python class `Rectangle` that demonstrates a simple example of inheritance.
- `1-square.py`: Illustrates inheritance by creating a class `Square` that inherits from `Rectangle`.
- Other files showcasing various inheritance scenarios and advanced concepts.

## Concepts Covered

- Basics of inheritance in Python
- Single inheritance
- Multiple inheritance
- Multilevel inheritance
- Method overriding and super()
- Abstract base classes (ABCs)

## Usage

To run and test the code in this repository, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/0x0A-Python-Inheritance.git
    ```

2. Navigate to the directory:

    ```bash
    cd 0x0A-Python-Inheritance
    ```

3. Run the Python files using your preferred Python interpreter:
