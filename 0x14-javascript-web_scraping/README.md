JavaScript Web Scraping
This project demonstrates web scraping using JavaScript. Web scraping involves extracting data from websites programmatically, typically using tools and libraries that simulate human interaction with web pages.

Description
In this project, we use Node.js along with the axios and cheerio libraries to scrape data from web pages.

Node.js: JavaScript runtime used for server-side scripting.
Axios: Promise-based HTTP client for making HTTP requests.
Cheerio: Fast, flexible, and lean implementation of core jQuery for the server.
The scrape.js script contains functions to fetch HTML content from a specified URL using axios, and then parse and extract desired data using cheerio.
