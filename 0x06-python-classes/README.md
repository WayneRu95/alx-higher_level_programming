## Description

In this project, we explore the concepts of classes and objects in Python. We delve into the principles of OOP by creating classes, defining attributes, and implementing methods. The project tasks involve solving various challenges using classes and objects, which help solidify the understanding of how OOP works in Python.

## Files Included

The following files are included in this project:

- `0-square.py`: Defines a class `Square` that represents a square.
- `1-square.py`: Adds a private instance attribute to the `Square` class.
- `2-square.py`: Adds validation of the `size` attribute in the `Square` class.
- ... (list additional files if present)

## Usage

To use these Python files, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/alx-project-0x06.git
Navigate to the project directory:

bash
Copy code
cd alx-project-0x06
Use the Python files as required in your Python environment or editor.

Learning Objectives
Understand the concept of classes and objects in Python.
Define and use attributes and methods within a class.
Implement encapsulation and abstraction principles in OOP.
Explore inheritance and polymorphism concepts.
How to Use
Each Python file in this project represents a specific task related to classes and objects in Python. To understand each task better, review the file's content, comments, and docstrings. Modify or use these classes and objects as needed in your own Python programs.
