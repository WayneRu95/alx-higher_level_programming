# 0x02 Python - Import Modules

Welcome to the 0x02-python-import_modules project repository! This project delves into the concept of importing modules in Python, allowing for modular and efficient code structuring. It is a part of the ALX software engineering curriculum.

## Description

This repository contains Python scripts and exercises demonstrating the utilization of modules, packages, and imports in Python programming. The project explores various methods of importing modules, aliasing, and leveraging external libraries for enhanced functionality.

## Content

The repository is organized into different directories, each housing scripts and exercises related to different aspects of importing modules:

- **0-import_a_function.py**: Contains a Python script that imports a function from another file and demonstrates its usage.
- **1-import_a_variable.py**: Includes a Python script importing a variable from another file and displaying its value.
- **2-import_multiple_functions.py**: Contains a Python script importing multiple functions from a file and illustrating their usage.
- **3-infinite_add.py**: Includes a Python script that performs addition on multiple arguments provided via the command line.
- **4-hidden_discovery.py**: Contains a Python script that prints names defined by a given compiled module.
- **5-variable_load.py**: Includes a Python script that imports a variable from a file and prints its value.

## Usage

To run any of the scripts within this repository, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine using `git clone`.
2. Navigate to the specific directory containing the script you want to execute.
3. Run the script using the command `python <script_name.py>`.

For example:
```bash
$ python 0-import_a_function.py
Make sure you have Python installed on your machine.
